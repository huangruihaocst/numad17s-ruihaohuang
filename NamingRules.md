#Naming Rules
##Directories
- lowercase
- no underscores
- packages: group by their funtions

##Java Files
- big Camel-case
- Same function in the same package

##Resource Files
- lowercase
- format: 
```[category(optional)]_[function(optional)]_[file name]```

 - category (optional): Its use in the project. e.g. activity, fragment, content. It is empty if it does not have a particular position. No underscores.
 - function (optional): Which function it belongs to. e.g. tictactoe. It is empty if it belongs to the main menu. No underscores.
 - file name: Whatever I want. Use underscores to divide words.
