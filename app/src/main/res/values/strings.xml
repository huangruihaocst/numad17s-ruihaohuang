        &lt;strong&gt;Strategy of my dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;
        I mainly used the SQLite database for storage and query.\
        Besides, I encoded the short words (not longer than 12 letters) to save space.\
        It is about 10% of the size before I encoded them.\
        To do this, I created two tables in my database. One is used for storing short words in integer,\
        the other is used for storing long words in text.\
        The database is created only once when you first open it but it is very time consuming.
        I also created indexes for the two tables to reduce complexity from O(n) to O(logn).\
        When querying if a word exists, I first determine if the word is a short word or a long word.\
        Then I query it in the correspondent table.\
        I did a test on its performance, which showed that 1000 times of querying takes about 200ms on an emulator,\
        about 400ms on my Nexus phone.\n\n

        This game is played just like
        regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile
        you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\
        \n\
        A tie happens when there are no further moves.
        In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for
        both sides in the larger game.
